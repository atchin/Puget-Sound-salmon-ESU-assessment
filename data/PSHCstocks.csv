The TRT used geography and environmental information as rationale for including the middle fork in the north fork population for recovery efforts.","Data are total escapement estimates based on carcass and redd counts in the North Fork and Middle Fork drainages.

Approximately 88% of recent spawners have been returns from the Kendall Creek Hatchery rebuilding program (including off-station releases at acclimation sites). Carcass recoveries (and spawning locations) correlate with release locations, so upper basin releases are influencing the primary spawning locations. Spawning also occurs in the lower North Fork. Various tributaries are also used, including Canyon, Racehorse, Boulder, Maple, Cornell, Deadhorse, Thompson and Boyd creeks. Spawning also occurs in the Middle Fork Nooksack, including Canyon Lake Creek.

However there appears to be some differentiation between Hood Canal-area chinook and South Sound chinook, indicating that some level of differentiation may be occurring in Hood Canal stocks following the cessation of transfers from South Sound hatcheries. Although allozyme allele frequency divergence is not evidence of local adaptation, it often signifies reproduction isolation. Local adaptations are more likely to be maintained in populations that are reproductively isolated (Marshall 2000)."

One distinguishing characteristic of this group of summer chum populations is an early nearshore marine area, adult run timing (early August into October). This early timing creates a temporal separation from the more abundant indigenous fall chum stocks which spawn in the same area, allowing for reproductive isolation between summer and fall chum stocks in the region (WDF et al. 1993).

For runsize > 6,300 a sharing formula is used with more fish being released into the lake (from the trap and haul operation)","This is a native stock with cultured production. Spawning of all or part of each year`s escapement takes place in artificial spawning beaches. Fry are transported to Baker Lake for rearing, then are trapped as smolts and trucked to the Baker River below the lower dam.",Odd-Year Pink,Baker sockeye were identified as a stock based on their distinct spawning distribution and genetic differences.,Data are counts at the Baker River adult trap at RM 0.25. They serve as estimates of total escapement since harvest of adult sockeye above the trap is negligible.,"Historically, spawning took place in the Baker River and Baker Lake. Access to these areas is now blocked by two dams. All returning adults are trapped and hauled above the dams. In many years all adults are taken to artificial spawning beaches. In years when the capacity of the spawning beaches is exceeded, fish that cannot be placed in the spawning beaches are released into Baker Lake and spawn mainly in the Baker River above the lake.",Allozyme analysis has shown Baker sockeye to be genetically distinct from all other Washington sockeye stocks examined (Gustafson and Winans 1999).

Recent genetic analysis (Spies 2002) suggests that Lake Washington/Sammamish Tribs sockeye are derived in part from introduced Baker sockeye.,Sockeye,Lake Washington/Sammamish Tribs sockeye were identified as a stock based on their distinct spawning distribution.,"Data are expanded total escapement counts of natural reproducing fish in tributaries to the Sammamish River and Lake Sammamish. Escapement is estimated using weekly live fish counts combined with the AUC method. Counts of live sockeye are conducted in tributaries to the Sammamish River and Lake Sammamish including Bear Creek, Cottage Lake Creek, Issaquah Creek, the East Fork Issaquah Creek, North Creek and Little Bear Creek, in most years. The stock has displayed a pattern of alternating high and low annual returns.",Most spawning takes place in the Bear Creek/Cottage Lake Creek system and in Issaquah Creek. Some spawning also occurs in Little Bear Creek and North Creek.,"Allozyme analysis has shown that Lake Washington/Sammamish Tribs sockeye are genetically distinct from the other Lake Washington sockeye stocks. Hendry (1995) suggested that sockeye spawning in Bear Creek may be native to Lake Washington. However, sockeye spawning in Issaquah Creek are similar to Baker River sockeye (Hendry 1995 and Shaklee et al. 1996). More recent microsatellite DNA analysis suggests that all Lake Washington sockeye stocks are, at least in part, descendants of introduced Baker sockeye (Spies 2002). Some early introductions of Baker sockeye were spawned at Issaquah Hatchery."

This stock was introduced from the Baker River.,Sockeye,Lake Washington Beach Spawning sockeye were identified as a stock based on their distinct spawning distribution.,"Data are total escapement estimates based on counts of live plus dead sockeye along the north shore of Mercer Island and portions of the east shore of Lake Washington (Shore Mile (SM) 34.3 - 34.7, SM 36.0 -37.0, and SM 39.0 -39.6). Peak counts are also provided from surveys on Mercer Island. Surveys for beach spawning sockeye have not been conducted regularly since 2005.  Total Natural Spawners escapement estimates are estimated based on Cedar River sockeye escapement or previous yearsâ?? data.","Spawning takes place in Lake Washington wherever suitable gravel beaches with upwelling are available, particularly along the north shore of Mercer Island and the east shore of Lake Washington.","Genetic analysis has shown Lake Washington Beach Spawning sockeye to be genetically similar to the introduced Baker River stock (Hendry 1995). More recent microsatellite DNA analysis also suggests that these fish, and all other Lake Washington sockeye may be, at least in part, descendants of introduced Baker sockeye (Spies 2002)."
131,5400,Cedar Sockeye,Sockeye,Other Sockeye Population Units,Not Warranted,3/25/1999,Puget Sound,No MPG Specified,"Total basin EG=350,000",This is a non-native stock with composite production. These fish were introduced into the Cedar River in the 1930s through fry plants of Baker River sockeye. Presently there is an expanding hatchery mitigation program at Landsburg where Landsburg Diversion Dam pipeline restricts upstream passage. Currently the target of the program is to release about 34 million sockeye fry into the Cedar River.,Sockeye,Cedar sockeye were identified as a stock based on their distinct spawning distribution and genetic composition.,"Data 1986- 1990 are run-size values based on Ballard Locks adult counts minus the escapement totals for non-Cedar stocks (Lake Washington/Sammamish and Lake Washington Beach Spawning sockeye stocks). These run-size values best represent the status of Cedar River sockeye salmon. Due to changes in migration patterns, recent escapement estimates for Cedar River sockeye are likely under-estimates and are not useful for rating stock status.     Data 1991-present are estimates of Total Natural Spawners. These data are expanded total escapement counts of natural reproducing fish. Escapement is estimated using weekly live fish counts combined with the AUC method. Estimates are based on counts between the Landsburg Dam (RM 21) and the mouth of the Cedar River, and represent estimates of the total Cedar River spawning escapement. Sockeye salmon are not passed upstream from Landsburg Dam.",Stock Spawning Distribution Spawning takes place throughout the mainstem Cedar River up to the Landsburg Diversion Dam and in the lower portions of some tributaries including Taylor Creek and Grass Creek.,"Allozyme analysis has shown Cedar sockeye to be significantly different from other Washington sockeye stocks examined but similar to Baker sockeye (Hendry 1995). More recent microsatellite DNA analysis also showed that Cedar sockeye are similar to Baker sockeye and suggests that these fish, and all other Lake Washington sockeye are, at least in part, descendants of introduced Baker sockeye (Spies 2002)."
